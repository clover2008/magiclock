A simple python utility to Unlock/Lock one's desktop screen with a PenDrive

Dependencies: Python2, UDev, UDisks, Tk python2-gobject

Make sure both the magiclock and magiclock-admin scripts are in your PATH and executable

Ubuntu users: install the python-tk package or create your own $HOME/.config/magiclock file with the Manufacturer Serial of the desired USB Key

Running: Just run magiclock.

Advance Usage:
	magiclock-admin supports two commandline switches: -s <Serial> -l <Locking Mode>
	Serial is the Manufacturer Serial of the Desired USB Key
	Locking Mode is 0 for both Unlocking and Locking, 1 for unlocking only

	calling with both switches doesn't call the GUI admin window. Useful if you don't want to install Tk just for this.

	magiclock supports one switch: -k
	-k is to kill the currently running magiclock process
